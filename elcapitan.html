 <p><b> OS X El Capitan (el-KAP-Éª-TAN)</b> (version 10.11) is the twelfth major release of OS X, Apple Inc.'s desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers. It is the successor to OS X Yosemite and focuses mainly on performance, stability and security.Following the California landmark-based naming scheme introduced with OS X Mavericks, El Capitan was named after a rock formation in Yosemite National Park.<br>

The first beta of OS X El Capitan was released to developers shortly following the 2015 WWDC keynote on June 8, 2015.The first public beta was made available on July 9, 2015.There were multiple betas released after the keynote. OS X El Capitan was released to end users on September 30, 2015, as a free upgrade through the Mac App Store<br>

<a href name="features"><h2>Features</h2></a>
OS X El Capitan includes features to improve the security, performance, design and usability of OS X.
Compared to OS X Yosemite, Apple says that opening PDFs is four times faster, app switching and viewing messages in 
Mail is twice as fast,and launching apps is 40% faster.The maximum VRAM allocation has been increased from 1024 MB to
1536 MB on Macs with an Intel HD 4000 GPU.OS X El Capitan supports Metal, Apple's graphics API introduced in iOS 8 to 
speed upperformance in games and professional applications.San Francisco replaces Helvetica Neue as the system typeface of 
 OS X El Capitan.<br>
<a href name="window"><h2>Window management</h2></a>
OS X El Capitan introduces support for snapping two windows side by side to create a split view, similar to the snap-assist 
feature in Windows 7 (and later) and several Linux desktop environments, such as GNOME. OS X El Capitan improves
 Mission Control to incorporate this feature across multiple spaces. It also enables users to spot the pointer more easily by
 enlarging it by shaking the mouse or swiping a finger back and forth on the trackpad.<br>
<a href name="app"> <h2>Applications</h2></a>

OS X El Capitan adds multi-touch gestures to applications like Mail and Messages that allow a user to delete or mark emails or
 conversations by swiping a finger on a multi-touch device, such as a trackpad. OS X also analyzes the contents of individual 
 emails in Mail and uses the gathered information in other applications, such as Calendar. For example, an invitation in Mail
 can automatically be added as a Calendar event.<br>
Apple Maps in El Capitan shows public transit information similar to Maps in iOS 9. This feature was limited to a handful 
of cities upon launch: Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York City, Paris, Philadelphia, 
San Francisco, Shanghai, Toronto and Washington D.C.<br>
The Notes application receives an overhaul, similar to Notes in iOS 9. Both applications have more powerful text-processing
 capabilities, such as to-do lists (like in the Reminders application), inline webpage previews, photos and videos, digital
 sketches, map locations and other documents and media types. Notes replaces traditional IMAP-based syncing with iCloud, 
 which offers better end-to-end encryption and faster syncing.<br>
Safari in El Capitan lets users pin tabs for frequently accessed websites to the tab bar, similar to Firefox and Google Chrome.
 Users are able to quickly identify and mute tabs that play audio without having to search for individual tabs. Safari supports
 AirPlay video streaming to an Apple TV without the need to broadcast the entire webpage. Safari extensions are now hosted and
 signed by Apple as part of the updated Apple Developer programme and Safari received native support for content blocking, 
 allowing developers to, among other things, block advertisements without JavaScript injection.<br>
Spotlight is improved with more contextual information such as the weather, stocks, news and sports scores. 
It is also able to process queries in natural language. For example, users can type "Show me pictures that I took in
 Yosemite National Park in July 2014" and Spotlight will use that request to bring up the corresponding info.<br>
 <a href name="sys"><h2>System Integrity Protection</h2></a>
      Main article: System Integrity Protection

OS X El Capitan has a new security feature called System Integrity Protection (SIP,sometimes referred to as "rootless") that
 protects certain system processes, files and folders from being modified or tampered with by other processes even when 
 executed by the root user or by a user with root privileges (sudo). Apple says that the root user can be a significant risk 
 factor to the system's security, especially on systems with a single user account on which that user is also the administrator
 . System Integrity Protection is enabled by default, but can be disabled.<br>
